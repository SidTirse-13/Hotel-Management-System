# 🏨 Hotel Management System – Java

This project is a Java-based console application designed to manage core hotel operations like room booking, food ordering, billing, and customer management. It follows object-oriented principles, uses file handling to persist data between sessions, and implements multithreading for background file saving. The system ensures a smooth user experience through custom exception handling and a menu-driven interface.


## 📌 Features

- ✅ **Room Booking** – Supports single and double room booking with customer details.
- ✅ **Food Ordering** – Allows ordering food items to specific rooms with price calculation.
- ✅ **Billing System** – Generates bills based on room charges and food orders.
- ✅ **Unbooking Rooms** – Deallocates rooms and frees them for new customers.
- ✅ **Room Availability Check** – Displays available rooms with features.
- ✅ **Persistent Data Storage** – Uses file handling to save and load hotel data between sessions.
- ✅ **Multithreading** – Runs file writing in a background thread for smoother user experience.
- ✅ **Exception Handling** – Includes user-defined exceptions and handles runtime errors gracefully.
- ✅ **Menu-Driven Interface** – Interactive command-line menu system for user operations.
